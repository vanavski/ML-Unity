MACHINE LEARNING

1. Genetic algorithms
2. Perceptron
3. NN

Genetic algorithms:

1. Camouflage:  (camouflage folder, camo scene)

Introduction

Breed bodies with specific color by genetic algorithm, which calculate best bodies by time to die value.

Population manager

Create new population every elapsed time and breed it by time to die

DNA script

Stored RGB, size, time to die and methods by click on body


2. Runners: (walker folder, WalkStraight scene)

Introduction

Breed characters with specific directions by genetic algorithm. Calculate the best directions by biggest alive time values

PManager

Instantiate characters with brains and set best directions values via the biggest time alive values.

Brain

Set properties like direction move, crouch, jump and check if character is alive and how long.

Dna

Mix set of genes values, set values of every gene, store gene with length and count.


3. Maze walker (GA Walekr/Maze folder, maze walker scene)

Introduction

Breed character directions with brains via distance travelled

MazePM

Instantiate characters with brains and set best directions values via the biggest distance travelled and alive values.

Brain maze

Check walls, check dead, check genes and change direction if character see wall via ray cast

Generate maze

Generate specific maze for characters

4. Flappy birds (birds folder, training room scene)

Introduction

Like maze walker, but with another properties. Breed birds with biggest travel distance

Perceptron 

Simple Perceptron (perceptron1 folder, Perceptron scene)

Introduction

Calculate simple perceptron with 1 layer for understanding how it works


1. Void Perceptron ( Void network folder, Dodge ball scene)

Introduction

Teach character to avoid the ball via logistic regression and perceptron

Throw script

Throw out the ball or the cube to character. Need to use 1,2,3,4 buttons.
Character must avoid 1st button.

Void Perceptron

Use simple perceptron. 
Use space button to re initialize weights. S button to save, l to load data from file.

Firstly, initialize weights, bias via random values.
Train our set of weights. Update weights reset weights and bias via error
Error calculate like predicted output â€“ actual output.
Actual output calculate via activation function which take logistic regression function.
Function looks like Sum += bias + weight[i]*input[i]
So, if result = 0, our character use crouch and avoid the ball

//TODO Add goodly perceptron, graph, Pong NN
